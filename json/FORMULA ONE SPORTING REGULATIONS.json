In such cases Competitors  must submit a formal request to the FIA detailing the reasons such components and/or  software need to be fitted.              j)   Only tyres manufactured specifically by the appointed tyre supplier for development for  the future Championship season or as determined as suitable by the FIA and the  appointed tyre supplier for the testing required by the FIA may be used.  k)   A maximum of forty (40) car days of testing is permitted between 1 January and 31  December organised by the FIA in consultation with all Competitors, and if required by  the testing objectives the appointed tyre supplier, and for the sole purpose of TMC.  i)  Drivers participating in these tests must be eligible for a Full Super Licence, and  must have either competed in at least one (1) Formula 1 Competition during their  careers or have previously completed a minimum of 500 km of running in a current  Formula One Car consistently at racing speeds.  ii)  Any such testing scheduled at a circuit hosting a Competition of the Championship  may only be carried out prior to that Competition if the following conditions are  met:  a)  The car used is a suitably modiﬁed car designed and constructed in order to  comply with the Technical Regulations of any of the four (4) calendar years  falling immediately prior to the year of the Championship and with the  exception of changes permitted under b), i) and m) must only use  components and software of a speciﬁcation that have been used in at least  one (1) race or TCC during any of the four (4) calendar years falling  immediately prior to the year of the Championship.  b)  The circuit hosted a Competition of the Championship in the year falling  immediately prior to the year of the Championship.  iii)   Subject to Article 10.10 k) ii), tests carried out between the end of the first  Competition of the Championship and 31 December must use mule cars satisfying  one of the two following conditions:  a)  Be a suitably modified car designed and constructed in order to comply with  the Technical Regulations of the Championship and with the exception of  changes permitted under b), i) and m) must only use components and  software of a specification that have been used in at least one (1) race or TCC  during the current year or any of the four (4) years falling immediately prior  to the year of the Championship.  b)  Be a suitably modified car designed and constructed in order to comply with  the Technical Regulations of any of the four (4) calendar years falling  immediately prior to the year of the Championship and with the exception  of changes permitted under b), i) and m) must only use components and  software of a specification that have been used in at least one (1) race or TCC  during any of the four (4) calendar years falling immediately prior to the year  of the Championship.  iv)   Tests carried out between 1 January and the end of the first Competition of the  Championship must use mule cars that are a suitably modified car designed and  constructed in order to comply with the Technical Regulations of any of the four (4)  calendar years falling immediately prior to the year of the Championship and with  the exception of changes permitted under b), i) and m) must only use components  and software of a specification that have been used in at least one (1) race or TCC  during any of the four (4) calendar years falling immediately prior to the year of the  Championship.              l)   In addition to the testing described in Article 10.10k, one (1) test, of one (1) day duration,  will be organised at the circuit at which the last Competition of the Championship was  held, for the sole purpose of providing Competitors with the opportunity to test the tyre  specifications to be used the following Championship. Such test will be conducted  coincident with the TCC defined in Article 10.8d:  i)  Drivers participating in this test must be eligible for a Full Super Licence, and must  have either competed in at least one (1) Formula 1 Competition during their careers  or have previously completed a minimum of 500 km of running in a current Formula  One Car consistently at racing speeds  ii)  Each Competitor must use one (1) mule car at this test which complies with the  provisions of Article 10.10a and Article 10.10b, and with the exception of changes  permitted under b), i) and m) must only use components and software of a  specification that have been used in at least one (1) race or TCC during the current  year or any of the four (4) years falling immediately prior to the year of the  Championship.  m)   All TMC must comply with the following:  i)   No test parts, test software or component changes will be permitted which give  any sort of information to the Competitor that is unrelated to the mule car test,  unless specifically requested by the FIA. Software and component changes are only  permitted if they are necessary for the correct evaluation of the test items or to  complete the test programme and must be approved by the FIA. A replacement  component may be approved in cases such as damage to the original and should  be of the same specification. Exceptionally, if a same specification component is  unavailable, a component of a different specification which has been previously  used at a Competition or TCC or TPC may be approved. For the avoidance of doubt,  components permitted under Article 40.2 c) may be changed, only if absolutely  necessary for changes in climatic conditions.  ii)   Mechanical set-up changes and driver control changes are only permitted if they  are necessary for the correct evaluation of the test items or to complete the test  programme. These changes must be agreed in advance with the FIA and the tyre  supplier if tyre testing is to be carried out.   iii)   Additional sensors may only be fitted on the car to measure tyre state and or  performance or if requested by the FIA and must be agreed with the appointed tyre  supplier when tyre testing is to be carried out and the FIA in advance. When tyre  testing is carried out data collected from such sensors must be shared with the  appointed tyre supplier in due time after the test session, and processed data from  such sensors (having removed any team-specific or FIA confidential information)  may be shared by the appointed tyre supplier with the other Competitors."

This set and one (1) further set (two sets in total) must be electronically returned  no later than two hours after the end of P2 unless:  i)  the driver was replaced in P1 by a driver under the provisions of Article 32.4c)  in which case only one (1) set must be returned,  ii)  or both P1 and P2 are either declared wet or cancelled, in which case one of  these sets may be retained by each driver but must be electronically returned  no later than two (2) hours after the end of P3.    v)  Two (2) further sets must be electronically returned no later than two (2) hours  after the end of P3                k)  Once all tyres have been returned electronically after the end of each day of on track  activity the appointed tyre supplier will publish a list of the tyres which each driver has  available to him for the remainder of the Competition.    l)  During any free practice session intermediate and wet-weather tyres may only be used  after the track has been declared wet by the Race Director, following which intermediate,  wet or dry-weather tyres may be used for the remainder of the session.  During the sprint qualifying session, the number of sets of intermediate or wet-weather  tyres is free within the allocation of each driver.    m)  For all races except the race in Monaco, unless they have used intermediate or wetweather tyres during the race, each driver must use at least two (2) different  specifications of dry-weather tyres during the race, at least one (1) of which must be a  mandatory dry-weather race tyre specification as defined in Article 30.2c)ii).  For the race in Monaco, each driver must use at least three (3) sets of tyres of any  specification described in Article 30.1a)i) during the race and, unless they have used  intermediate or wet-weather tyres during the race, each driver must use at least two (2)  different specifications of dry-weather tyres during the race, at least one (1) of which must  be a mandatory dry-weather race tyre specification as defined in Article 30.2c)ii).      Unless the race is suspended and cannot be re-started, failure to comply with these  requirements will result in the disqualification of the relevant driver from the race results.  For all races except the race in Monaco, if the race is suspended and cannot be re-started,  thirty (30) seconds will be added to the elapsed time of any driver who did not, when  required to do so, use at least two (2) specifications of dry-weather tyre during the race.  For the race in Monaco, if the race is suspended and cannot be re-started, thirty (30)  seconds will be added to the elapsed time of any driver who did not, when required to do  so, use at least two (2) specifications of dry-weather tyre during the race, or who did not  use at least three (3) sets of tyres of any specification during the race. Furthermore, an  additional thirty (30) seconds will be added to the elapsed time of any driver who used  only one (1) set of tyres of any specification during the race.    n)  If the formation lap is started behind the safety car in accordance with Article 49.1a, or  the sprint session or race is resumed in accordance with Article 58.1, the use of wetweather tyres until the safety car orange lights are extinguished and it returns to the pit  lane is compulsory. A penalty under Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver whose  tyre(s) are changed for a different specification or who uses any other specification of  tyres whilst the safety car is on the track at such times.    o)  If additional specifications of dry-weather tyres are made available in accordance with  Article 30.1a)iii), these tyres will be allocated to each Driver for use during P2. If P2 is  unsuitable for the evaluation of these tyres (such as due to poor weather) they will not  be made available to each Driver and they may be carried over to the back-up  Competition, as advised by the FIA. Unless the additional tyres have not been made  available, or the session is declared wet, all Drivers will have to use them during P2,  according to run plans specified by the appointed tyre supplier with the same number of  laps per Driver, and the only dry weather tyres that may be used are those allocated under  Article 30.1a)iii).  i)  Drivers participating in this session to evaluate additional tyres must be in  possession of a Super Licence or Free Practice Super Licence, and must have  competed in at least one (1) Formula 1 Competition during their careers.              ii)  Test parts, test software, component changes and set-up changes    Test parts and test software are permitted. However, the car must remain in a fixed  specification, configuration and set-up. Mechanical set-up changes, driver control  changes, software and component changes are only permitted if they are necessary  for the correct evaluation of the tyres or to complete the tyre test. Set-up changes  and driver control changes must be agreed in advance with the tyre supplier.  Component and software changes must be approved by the FIA. A replacement  component may be approved in cases such as damage to the original and should  be of the same specification. Exceptionally, if a same specification component is  unavailable, a component of a different specification which has been previously  used at a Competition or TCC may be approved.  iii)  Additional sensors and logging  Additional sensors may be fitted on the car to measure tyre state and or  performance and must be agreed with the appointed tyre supplier and the FIA in  advance. Data collected from such sensors must be shared with the appointed tyre  supplier in due time after the test session, and processed data from such sensors  (having removed any team-specific information) may be shared by the appointed  tyre supplier with the other Competitors.  iv)  All additional tyres allocated in accordance with Article 30.1a)iii) must be  electronically returned no later than two (2) hours after the end of P2.

In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from  the time at which the “RED FLAG” message appears on the official messaging system until  the time that each car crosses the first safety car line when entering the pit lane, drivers  must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling  sector (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light  panels).  b)  All cars abandoned on the track will be removed to a safe place.  c)  At the end of each free practice session, any period of the qualifying session (Q1, Q2, Q3)  or any period of the sprint qualifying session (SQ1, SQ2, SQ3) no driver may cross the Line  more than once.
