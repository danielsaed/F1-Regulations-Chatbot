It will be enabled, and may only be used by the driver, if  he is less than one (1) second behind another at any of the pre-determined detection  points around each track.  e)  The system will be disabled by the control electronics the first time the driver uses the  brakes after he has activated the system.              f)  In conditions of poor visibility, or if yellow flags are being shown in the activation zone,  the Race Director may, at his absolute discretion, disable all such systems until conditions  improve or yellow flags are withdrawn.  g)  The FIA may, after consulting all Competitors, adjust the above time proximity in order to  ensure the stated purpose of the adjustable bodywork is met.  h)  In the event of a failure in the system which notifies the driver that he was within one (1)  second of the car in front, and is hence authorised to use the adjustable bodywork, the  Competitor concerned may ask the Race Director for permission to override the system.  If permission is given in this way the onus will be upon the Competitor concerned to  ensure that their driver only uses the adjustable bodywork if he is within one (1) second  of the car in front of him.  i)  If the failure in the system is rectified the driver may no longer use this override, the Race  Director will notify the Competitor if and when the fault has been remedied."

For all races except the race in Monaco, if the race is suspended and cannot be re-started,  thirty (30) seconds will be added to the elapsed time of any driver who did not, when  required to do so, use at least two (2) specifications of dry-weather tyre during the race.  For the race in Monaco, if the race is suspended and cannot be re-started, thirty (30)  seconds will be added to the elapsed time of any driver who did not, when required to do  so, use at least two (2) specifications of dry-weather tyre during the race, or who did not  use at least three (3) sets of tyres of any specification during the race. Furthermore, an  additional thirty (30) seconds will be added to the elapsed time of any driver who used  only one (1) set of tyres of any specification during the race.    n)  If the formation lap is started behind the safety car in accordance with Article 49.1a, or  the sprint session or race is resumed in accordance with Article 58.1, the use of wetweather tyres until the safety car orange lights are extinguished and it returns to the pit  lane is compulsory. A penalty under Article 54.3d) will be imposed on any driver whose  tyre(s) are changed for a different specification or who uses any other specification of  tyres whilst the safety car is on the track at such times.    o)  If additional specifications of dry-weather tyres are made available in accordance with  Article 30.1a)iii), these tyres will be allocated to each Driver for use during P2. If P2 is  unsuitable for the evaluation of these tyres (such as due to poor weather) they will not  be made available to each Driver and they may be carried over to the back-up  Competition, as advised by the FIA. Unless the additional tyres have not been made  available, or the session is declared wet, all Drivers will have to use them during P2,  according to run plans specified by the appointed tyre supplier with the same number of  laps per Driver, and the only dry weather tyres that may be used are those allocated under  Article 30.1a)iii).  i)  Drivers participating in this session to evaluate additional tyres must be in  possession of a Super Licence or Free Practice Super Licence, and must have  competed in at least one (1) Formula 1 Competition during their careers.              ii)  Test parts, test software, component changes and set-up changes    Test parts and test software are permitted. However, the car must remain in a fixed  specification, configuration and set-up. Mechanical set-up changes, driver control  changes, software and component changes are only permitted if they are necessary  for the correct evaluation of the tyres or to complete the tyre test. Set-up changes  and driver control changes must be agreed in advance with the tyre supplier.  Component and software changes must be approved by the FIA. A replacement  component may be approved in cases such as damage to the original and should  be of the same specification. Exceptionally, if a same specification component is  unavailable, a component of a different specification which has been previously  used at a Competition or TCC may be approved.  iii)  Additional sensors and logging  Additional sensors may be fitted on the car to measure tyre state and or  performance and must be agreed with the appointed tyre supplier and the FIA in  advance. Data collected from such sensors must be shared with the appointed tyre  supplier in due time after the test session, and processed data from such sensors  (having removed any team-specific information) may be shared by the appointed  tyre supplier with the other Competitors.  iv)  All additional tyres allocated in accordance with Article 30.1a)iii) must be  electronically returned no later than two (2) hours after the end of P2.
